I work with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **React** ‚Äî often in ways that spiral into component libraries, CLI tools, and overengineered screenshot utilities.  
Sometimes I even finish them.

I'm a **hobbyist developer**, not chasing the corporate ladder ‚Äî just building things because it's fun (_and because the alternative is meetings_).  
You could say I prefer shipping over synergies.

By day, I manage warehouse logistics and keep an e-commerce distribution account from combusting.  
Somewhere along the way, I became the local Excel oracle ‚Äî probably because I once used a formula with more than three parentheses.  
Now it's just part of the job description.

By night, I‚Äôm a dad to a wildly curious 9-year-old who asks questions I have to Google.  
We get along great.

### What you'll find here:

- ‚ú® Components, utilities, and over-thought ideas  
- üß™ Experiments that accidentally became features  
- üìÅ Projects that are absolutely still in progress, thank you for asking

üß† Writing code is easy. Naming things is the real boss fight.  
üñ•Ô∏è Linux, Windows, macOS ‚Äî because I like having trust issues with all three.
