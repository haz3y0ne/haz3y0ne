I work with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **React** ‚Äî often building tools, libraries, or workflows to simplify the repetitive. I lean toward creating things that are modular, reusable, and a little overengineered (in a good way).

I'm not aiming for flashy. I'm aiming for useful, readable, and maintainable.

Outside of development, I manage the logistics behind an e-commerce operation. Between that and software, I live at the intersection of automation, process, and practicality.  
And yeah ‚Äî I‚Äôve seen things in Excel that most people wouldn‚Äôt believe.

### On this GitHub you'll find:

- Components and utilities I built to scratch a real itch  
- Tools that reduce friction in workflows  
- Experiments that taught me something  
- Projects in progress, because good ideas take time

üß† Naming things is still the hardest part.  
üñ•Ô∏è Linux, Windows, macOS ‚Äî because one platform is never enough for the edge cases I run into.

  <summary>üì¶ A few extras</summary>

  - Built CLI tools before knowing what "flags" were  
  - Invested more thought in folder structure than I‚Äôd like to admit  
  - Has more half-finished projects than open tabs ‚Äî and that‚Äôs saying something
