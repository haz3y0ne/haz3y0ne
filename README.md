I mostly write JavaScript, TypeScript, and React ‚Äî usually while convincing myself that I *need* to make a custom component library or write another CLI tool.

Half of what I build starts with ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be cool if...‚Äù and ends with a README that says ‚ÄúStill working on it.‚Äù

By accident, I became the Excel guy. It started with one formula and now I have a reputation.

By night, I‚Äôm a dad to a curious 9-year-old who keeps me on my toes (and occasionally Googling answers).

- Experiments that may or may not work in Firefox

  <summary>üì¶ Fun facts I didn‚Äôt know where else to put</summary>

  - First CLI tool was just to avoid copy/pasting ZIP codes  
  - Has a backlog longer than his son‚Äôs Christmas list  
  - Once spent 45 minutes naming a folder. No regrets.
